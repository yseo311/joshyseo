#Problem 1
```{r Problem1}
#create a fair die
fair_die <- die()
#roll the die 4000 times
rolls_4000 <- roll(fair_die, 4000)

#a is a sequence of numbers 1, 5, 9, 13,...,3997
a <- seq(1, 4000, 4)

#b is a sequence of numbers 4, 8, 12, 16,...,4000
b <- seq(4, 4000, 4)

#c is a list that will contain number of "6" in every 4 rolls
c <- vector()

#Count the number of "6" in [1:4], [5:8],...,[3997:4000] and store it in c[1:1000]
for (i in 1:1000){
c[i] <- sum(rolls_4000$rolls[a[i]:b[i]] == "6")
}

#count the number of "4-roll-game" that has at least one "6"
sum(c[1:1000] != 0)

#Relative frequency of "4-roll-game" with at least one "6"
sum(c[1:1000] != 0)/1000

#Analytical Computation
1 - (5/6)^4

#Result
#We can conclude that the empirical data we obtained through the experiment is very close to the analytically computed value
```


#Problem 2
```{r Problem2}

#Count the number of "6" in every couple rolls
for (i in 1:24000){
z[i] <- sum(rolls_48000$rolls[x[i]:y[i]] == "6")

sum(k[1:1000] != 0)
